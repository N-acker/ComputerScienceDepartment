# 🏫 Computer Science Department (CSD) Software

A digital management system designed for a university's Computer Science Department, developed to streamline departmental operations and enhance administrative efficiency.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

This project serves as a comprehensive software solution for managing various aspects of a university's Computer Science Department. Through its development, key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles were applied and reinforced.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Student Information Management**: Efficiently store and retrieve student records, including personal details, academic performance, and enrollment status.
- **Course Administration**: Manage course offerings, schedules, and instructor assignments.
- **Faculty Management**: Maintain faculty profiles, track teaching assignments, and facilitate communication between staff and students.
- **Resource Allocation**: Oversee the allocation of departmental resources such as laboratories, equipment, and study materials.

## 🧑‍💻 Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Development Environment**: Eclipse IDE
- **Version Control**: Git

## 🏗️ Object-Oriented Programming Concepts Applied

This project provided hands-on experience with several OOP concepts:

- **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex systems by modeling classes appropriate to the problem.
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data with methods that operate on that data, restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
- **Inheritance**: Creating new classes based on existing classes to promote code reusability.
- **Polymorphism**: Allowing entities to be represented in multiple forms, enabling a single interface to control access to a variety of data types.

Additionally, relationships such as **association**, **aggregation**, and **composition** were explored to define how classes interact within the system.

## 🚀 Getting Started
